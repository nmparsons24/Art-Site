        <h1> Breathing New Life into Canvas:  </h1>
        <h1>The Art of Nancy </h>
            <p> Nancy is a mixed-media artist based in the Isles of Scilly, drawing inspiration from the rugged landscapes, ever-changing seascapes, and rich wildlife of the islands. Passionate about sustainability, she creates unique artworks using offcuts of canvas from Ratbags, a local bag-making shop, giving new life to discarded materials.

            Her work captures the essence of the islands, from the dramatic sunsets over Bishop Rock to the graceful motion of seabirds like gannets, puffins, and herring gulls. Through textured layering and bold compositions, Nancy brings a tactile quality to her pieces, reflecting both her background in art and her deep connection to the natural world.
                
            Each artwork is a tribute to the beauty and resilience of the Isles of Scilly, inviting viewers to experience the wild and untamed spirit of the coast.
